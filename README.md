Important:
The server is already started but you can restart it by executing the next url: https://block-chest.com/PixelWars/ReiniciarServidor.php
Restart a blockwars server eliminates all current users and return the server to round 0. Do it with confidence because the current server is exclusively dedicated to the Moralis x Cronos hackathon.
